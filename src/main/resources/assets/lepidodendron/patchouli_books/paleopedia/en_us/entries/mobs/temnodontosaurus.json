Like other Ichthyosaurs, Temnodontosaurus would've had very high visual capacity. It would've likely swam the open oceans, snapping at belemnites and other prey. "

The skull was first discovered by Joseph Anning in 1811 and the rest of the skeleton was discovered by his sister Mary Anning the year later. Though it was originally named Ichthyosaurus, it was later renamed as Temnodontosaurus in 1889 by Richard Lydekker. Temnodontosaurus is featured at Crystal Palace."
