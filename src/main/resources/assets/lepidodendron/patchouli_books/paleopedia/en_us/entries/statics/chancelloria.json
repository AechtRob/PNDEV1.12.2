			"text": "Chancelloria comes from the Cambrian, with fossils found across the globe. It is a large chancelloriid, growing up to 20 cm in height. Despite appearances, Chancelloria is not a sponge, although was considered as one up until 2008, with recent phylogenetic studies placing them within Eumetazoa, between Placoza and Cnidaria. It is cylindrical in shape and was adorned with star-shaped spines, which got tighter and larger near its top, surrounding an opening."
