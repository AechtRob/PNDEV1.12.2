This fish, as large as 32 cm long, is known from the Kota formation of India, found in what were once freshwater sediments, making it a precious species of freshwater Jurassic faunas, notoriously scarce and poorly studied."

Larger specimens had more thoroughly ossified roofs of their skulls,"

The rather short jaws terminated in a series of 15-16 teeth, the last of which towards the tip of the snout was quite larger and probably would've looked like a small tusk to an outside observer. Curiously enough, despite the name directly referencing its close cousin Dapedium"

The dorsal fin in Paradapedium originated towards the midpoint of the body and proceeded to run its length up to the base of the tail in a row of around 35 rays, in opposition with the smaller anal fin, which possessed only around 25 rays and ran not even half the length of its dorsal counterpart."
