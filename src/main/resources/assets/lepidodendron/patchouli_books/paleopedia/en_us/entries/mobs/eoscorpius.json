It is a small eoscorpid scorpion, growing up to 30 cm in length, with a possible length of 30 cm. It most likely lived within the large coal-swamps of the Carboniferous, with evidence that its habitat ranged from the forest floors right up into the canopies, and would have going extinct alongside"

When the type species E. carbonarius was originally described in 1868, it was assigned to the modern genus Buthus as B. carbonarius, although the people describing it made hints it likely wasn't apart of this genus, and as such suggested a possible name, and the one that would be used later, Eoscorpius. And this was indeed used when a study in 1882 split all known Carboniferous scorpion species could be assigned to"

Most of these would be later refuted, but Eoscorpius would continue being accepted, until 1911. when it was suggested that species assigned to Eoscorpius belonged to other genera, Cyclophthalmus, Archaeoctonus, and Anthracoscorpio. Although only two years later in 1913, the validity of Eoscorpius was proven again, and it has remained its own genus ever since."
