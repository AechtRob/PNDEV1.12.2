Given that most of the material usually thought of as \"Brachiosaurus\" is actually Giraffatitan, a lot of size estimations for Brachiosaurus actually refer to its more complete African cousin, making it difficult to estimating size for this animal further compounded not only by its fragmentary nature but the apparently subadult nature of the remains as well."

The reason Brachiosaurus and Giraffatitan are oftentimes thought of interchangeably by the public is that the latter was originally described as an African species of the former, creating an association of material which lead to the reconstruction of Brachiosaurus historically using Giraffatitan material."
