The holotype contains 23 vertebrae, both humeri, and multiple bones of the left leg; along with this, a couple teeth were attributed to it as the paratype."

Even with the uncertain classification, it makes Gasosaurus one of the oldest genera within its clade. Gasosaurus is part of the paleobiota of the Lower Shaximiao Formation which was a typical terrestrial freshwater environment"

Based on palaeoenvironmental studies, it is suggested that the formation contained a large perennial lake that turned into a number of small short-lived lakes within a large alluvial plain whenever water levels became lower. Over the length of the time that the Shaximiao Formation covers, the climate was semihumid to semiarid and became drier and cooler over time."
