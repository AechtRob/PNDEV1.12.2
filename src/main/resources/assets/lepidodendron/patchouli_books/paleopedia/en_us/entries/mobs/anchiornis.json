Perhaps most famous for being among the first dinosaurs to have at least partial pieces of their body examined to determine their color, the animal was quite small in size, only about 60 cm long for the largest known specimens."

The animal was first described in 2009 by paleontologist Xu Xing based on this first specimen, which was articulated yet incomplete, missing head, tail and even one of the forelimbs."

In 2010 one specimen of Anchiornis, BMNHC PH828, was analyzed to study the shapes and sizes of the preserved melanosomes in the feathers,"

In 2015 a similar study was carried out on a different specimen which didn't yield the same results; this second specimen didn't have the red feathers on the head, leading to several "
