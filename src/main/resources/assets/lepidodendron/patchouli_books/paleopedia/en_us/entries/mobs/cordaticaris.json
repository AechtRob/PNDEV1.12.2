Hurdiid radiodonts are known for their large and impressive tripartite cephalic carapaces and Cordaticaris is a prime example of such structures. The animal is known from a series of cephalic armour pieces, including a large heart shaped central element, the frontal appendages,"

The central element of this animal's shell was ornamented with more than 20 rows of microscopic tubercles, which would stop at its ventral margin.

The shape of the oral cone in this animal, moreover, debunked the long standing idea that Amplectobeloids and Hurdiids could be distinguished by the presence of node bearing plates in the oral cone,"
