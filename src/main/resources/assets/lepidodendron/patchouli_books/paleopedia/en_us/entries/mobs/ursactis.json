Despite its recent description, as per the time of writing, the animal is already the most abundant Cambrian Polychaete known to date, hailing from a recently discovered locality within the Burgess Shales known as Tokumm Creek and counting more than 580 specimens."

Specimens of Ursactis have been found in clusters with more than a dozen each, potentially hinting at these animals living in loose communities. This animal had a remarkably low amount of segments"

The head of Ursactis possessed two palps which would be around 1/5th as long as the whole body of the animal."
