Meaning \"Horned Lizard\", the dinosaur is perhaps among the most famous of Jurassic Theropods, easily recognized by the crests growing on the nose and above the eyes and its proportionally large teeth, muscular legs, reduced arms and the singular row of osteoderms running down its back."

			"text": "Although not directly related to birds, the hip bones of Ceratosaurus were fused together in a similar fashion to one. The type specimen the animal was described on was around 5.5 m long but it's unclear if it was fully grown or not, with authors such as David Norman who estimated it growing up to 6.1 m long in 1985, estimation based on an exceptionally large specimen found in the 60s."

Further species of Ceratosaurus past the type one have since been discovered, although their validity remains contested to this day."

It took more than a century for Marsh's original analysis to gain credibility and be widely accepted as before that many authors classified the animal either under Megalosauria, Carnosauria or Coelurosauria, even being considered the most basal Theropod after the Triassic by Gilmore in 1920."
