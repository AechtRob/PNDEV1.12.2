Whilst small, it is amongst one of the larger tubular forms in the Ediacaran, growing up to 15 cm in height. The morphology of their tubes consisted of little vases stacked on top of one another, and whilst the composition of the tubes remains unknown, it is possibly made from high-magnesium calcite. As for its mode of life,"
