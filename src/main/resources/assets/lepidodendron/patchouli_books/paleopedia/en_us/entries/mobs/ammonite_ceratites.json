			"text": "Ceratites is a genus of ceratitid ammonite from the Middle Triassic. This ammonite developed to live deeper underwater, where pressures on its shell would have been higher, pushing for the development of stronger sutures between the various pieces of the shell. These sutures, present in all ammonites between various sections of the shell, are classified under three different groups based on their shape; Ceratites had so called Ceratitic suture "

These sutures in ammonites are usually covered up in life so in a live ammonite you wouldn't be able to see them, however, once the outer sheath is stripped off the shell, these lines appear and are actually used in the identification of ammonites more than the actual shell is."

			"text": "The shape of the living chamber and buoyancy of the shell demonstrates how this animal was much more stable than other ammonites, with the aperture of the shell laying almost horizontally and allowing the animal to move without the being rocked back and forth from the intermittent propulsion. Ceratites wasn't a particularly fast animal also due to its large ribs creating drag and adding weight to it,"
