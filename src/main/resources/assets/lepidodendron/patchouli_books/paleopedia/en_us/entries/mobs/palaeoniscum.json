Only around 30 cm long, this fish was covered in heavy Ganoid scales, much like other primitive Ray finned fishes of its time, but unlike them, Palaeoniscum had a strong tail and long fins, "

The animal also possessed an early substitute for a swim bladder in the presence of internal air sacs connected to the digestive tract, which gave the animal better buoyancy in the water. The head was short and sported some very large eyes, while the mouth was armed with small conical teeth, able to be replaced when consumed, like modern day sharks."
