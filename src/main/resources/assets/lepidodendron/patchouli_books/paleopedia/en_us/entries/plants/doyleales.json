			"text": "Doyleales is an Order of fossils known from the Early Cretaceous northern hemisphere, particularly in North America where there seems to be quite a diversity found in the Apple Bay formation. They are cone fossils, named after the type species, Doylea tetrahedrasperma. This cones show unique features and sometimes preserve cup-shaped seeds, and it is uncertain where these plants sit in terms of their relationships."

Some authors assign them to the Corystosperms (which is the group of plants including Dicroidium, Pachypteris and Komlopteris, amongst others). Other prefer to place this Order as a group within the Pinopsids (along with groups such as Araucariales, Cupressales, Pines, Gnetales, Cheirolepidiaceae, and so on)."
