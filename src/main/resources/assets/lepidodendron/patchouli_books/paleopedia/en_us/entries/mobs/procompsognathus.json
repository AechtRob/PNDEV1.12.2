			"text": "Procompsognathus, despite its name, is not actually a compsognathid, but rather a coelophysid. It is known from the Triassic of Germany and was quite small, at only around 1 meter in length. The taxonomic history of this animal is complex. Originally regarded as a species of Hallopus, it was eventually named Procompsognathus under the assumption that it was the direct ancestor to the Jurassic Compsognathus."

			"text": "However, this was not supported by further research, and it has since landed closer to Coelophysis. Like other coelophysids, this dinosaur was likely a hunter, though, due to its size, it probably hunted much smaller animals like insects and early squamates. Procompsognathus is also thought to be a good runner on account of a proportionally lengthened tibia as compared to its relatives."
