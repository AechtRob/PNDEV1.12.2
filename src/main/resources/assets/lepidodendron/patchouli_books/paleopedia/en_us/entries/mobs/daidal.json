It is a small daidalid, growing up to 8 cm in length. Daidal has been through several revisions, with the remains themselves being described nearly a century before being given their current name."

In 1998, another species (D. acanthocercus) would be seperated from the genus Bairdops as Tyrannophontes acanthocercus. The most recent species (D. schoellmanni) from Germany would be described as Gorgonophontes fraiponti in 2004."

P. pattoni would soon follow suit, as it was found that it was similar to D. acanthocercus due to the pleon and telson,"

And finally G.fraiponti was also recongised as being similar to D. acanthocercus, and was not only moved to the Daidal genus, but was given a new specific name, now being D. schoellmanni. The generic name derives from the name of a Takelma spirit of the same name."
