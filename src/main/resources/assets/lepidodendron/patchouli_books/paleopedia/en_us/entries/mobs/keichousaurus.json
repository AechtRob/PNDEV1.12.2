			"type": "text",
			"text": "Some specimens attributed to the species have demonstrated the animal was viviparous, giving live birth instead of laying eggs. Hunting mainly small fish, Keichousaurus was an apt predator in its environment, using its front limbs to propel the body while the hindlegs would stabilize it in the water."

Particularly common in the fossil record, this animal is known from several complete or almost complete specimens, most commonly preserved in dorsal view."
