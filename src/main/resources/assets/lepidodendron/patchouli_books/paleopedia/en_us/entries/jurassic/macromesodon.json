Up to half a meter in length, this animal would have used the down-pointed mouth to pick hard foods it would then crush using the specialized battery of flattened teeth plating the inside of its mouth."

			"type": "text",
			"text": "Differentiating this animal from other members of its group are a series of features both derived and primitive coming together in a weird mix; The fish had an oval and flattened body with a large dorsal fin towards the base of the rounded caudal fin, while the anal fin was opposed to the dorsal but much smaller than the latter."

			"advancement": "lepidodendron:pf_adv_book_macromesodon",
			"type": "text",
			"text": "The head was flattened and down-pointing, attached to a body sometimes square-shaped by a gibbosity in the front. Macromesodon is an archaic member among Pycnodonts, which are Actinopterygians close to Teleosts, the group of fishes which encapsulates more than 90% of all living fishes today."
