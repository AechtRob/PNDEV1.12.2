They are small animals, rarely larger than 5 centimeters, with a wide, rounded carapace and a pair of long tails. Tadpole shrimp are commonly found in shallow or temporary bodies of water, and are well-adapted for ephemeral conditions. In many species, eggs are capable"

Thus, despite being fully aquatic, notostracans can survive in environments as dry as the Mojave Desert and the Australian Outback. They are omnivorous and feed on plant material, arthropods, and even small fish. Despite a superficial resemblance to horseshoe crabs, they are most closely related to fairy"

Interestingly, this group of crustaceans, the branchiopods, are more closely related to insects than to malacostracan crustaceans such as crabs and true shrimp. It has thus been suggested that insects and branchiopods such as tadpole shrimp may have a shared origin in ancient freshwater habitats,"
