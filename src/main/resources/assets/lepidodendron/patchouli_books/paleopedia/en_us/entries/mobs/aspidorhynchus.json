The most obvious characteristic of Aspidorhynchus was the elongated rostrum, which would grow to be visibly longer than the jaw, giving the head the characteristic spear nosed"

The body of Aspidorhynchus was long and streamlined with dorsal and anal fins moved back towards the tail, a characteristic that allowed the animal to gain additional thrust, making it a very fast predator in its waters."

Aspidorhynchus holds the status of being among the first fossil fishes to have ever been illustrated, with its first artistic representation being dated all the way back to 1775, a whole 58 years prior to its official description by Louis Agassiz in 1833 in his work \"Recherches sur les poissons fossiles\"."

After the redescription of the first fossil materials, several other species were instituted based on specimens from Solnhofen and Eichstaett, although probably all part of the same species or misidentified."

Eventually fossils of Aspidorhynchus started being described from other regions as well, like Britain, France and James Ross Island in the Antarctic."
