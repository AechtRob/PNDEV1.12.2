			"text": "Dysalotosaurus is a genus of Dryomorph Iguanodontian from the Late Jurassic of Africa. This 2.5 m long animal would've prowled what is today the Tendaguru formation in large groups, making full use of its long and powerful legs to traverse its environment at full speed. The proportion of the bones in the leg and long and robust tail suggest it was a fast and efficient runner;"

			"text": "Studies of its anatomy indicate the animal would've held its head forward while not feeding. It lived in arid, sparsely forested environments but, unlike Dryosaurus, this animal was smaller and more specialized for running. Dysalotosaurus is known from thousands of bones and fragments from what was probably a mass death event; "

Thanks to the wealth of fossil material of the animal, we can estimate that it lived for around 20 years and reached sexual maturity at 10; it was also Omnivorous for the first part of their lives before switching to full herbivory in adulthood."
