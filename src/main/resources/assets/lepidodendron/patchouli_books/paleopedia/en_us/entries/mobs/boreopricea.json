			"text": "Boreopricea funerea comes from the Lower Triassic, with fossils found on Kolguyev Island, Russia. It is a small archosauromorph, growing up to 44 cm in length. Boreopricea is fairly unique in the fact it was found inside a bore-hole sample that had been taken on Kolguyyev Island, and is fairly complete, only missing a few bits of its skeleton, and since its description, more bones had been lost or crushed in storage, muddying the waters in its assignment and slowing"

It is also unique in that it has a contact between its jugal and squamosal bones and the rear of its skull, something not seen in early archosauromorphs. There is also a probable second specimen, consisting of a snout, although no one has been able to locate this, and is considered lost."
