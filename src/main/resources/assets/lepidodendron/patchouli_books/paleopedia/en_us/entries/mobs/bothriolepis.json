			"text": "Bothriolepis was a genus of widespread antiarch placoderm from the Devonian. The animal was found all across the globe and inhabited both freshwater and saltwater. The genus was comprised of 60 species, averaging around 30 centimeters in length. However, Bothriolepis rex was much larger, reaching estimated lengths of 170 centimeters! "

			"text": "Bothriolepis was a bottom feeder, using its heavy body and ventrally located mouth to sift through sediment and eat anything edible it could find. The nostrils of this fish were located up around the eyes, allowing it to breathe and not inhale sediment as it ate."

Specimens of this animal have been found preserving soft tissue, showing the gills, digestive system, and even rudimentary lungs, suggesting that Bothriolepis could breathe air!"
