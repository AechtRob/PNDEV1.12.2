This genus, eponymous to its own family, is the better known among it's kin and was only one of four genera of Heterodontosaurians to have been discovered in the formation it comes from."

It was once believed Heterodontosaurus to have been a quadruped, hypothesis today refuted in favor of a bipedal model."
