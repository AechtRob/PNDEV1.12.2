The animal, in many aspects similar to the slightly older Dunyu, was a small jawless fish possessing a long and thin medial opening on the top of the head, around 6 times longer than wide."

			"text": "The head armor was circular in shape and ending on two low horn like structures creating the vertices at the back of its head. Quite a small animal, the length of the head shield would not go over 4 cm, with the largest specimen being 3.7 cm long along its midline."

			"type": "text",
			"text": "Due to the shape and anatomy of the headshield in Galeaspids, being an unsegmented and sutureless carapace, it is thought these animals would only acquire this extremely characteristic feature at near to full growth, explaining the limited size range seen in these animals."
