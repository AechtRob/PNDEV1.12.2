			"text": "Essexella is a prehistoric sea anemone known from many specimens excavated from Mazon Creek. It is a marine organism, being part of the Essex Biota, which forms the marine portion of the Mazon Creek. It was formerly interpreted as a jellyfish and even as a sponge, but recent studies place it as a weird sea anemone. Another Mazon Creek fossil, Reticulomedusa, is likely just Essexella preserved from a different angle."
