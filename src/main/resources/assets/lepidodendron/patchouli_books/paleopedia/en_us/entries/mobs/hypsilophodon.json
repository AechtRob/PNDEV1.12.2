It is a small hypsilophodontid, growing to 2 m in length, and weighing up to 20 kg. Found in 1849, it was originally considered to be a young Iguandon, which went unquestioned until 1867 when its known material was compared with known material of Iguandon, with it being concluded to be a separate species. This was further."

			"text": "supported by the discovery of skull material within the same area the original material was found just a year later in 1868, again presumed to be a younger Iguandon, or a smaller species within the genus. After studies of the skull (and accompanying post-cranial material) were done, it was finally concluded that the material from the Wessex Formation was of an entirely new species, with this being announced only a year later in 1869."

The specific name derives from the surname of William Fox, a English clergyman and palaeontologist, who is most well known for his work on the Isle of Wight, and was the discoverer of the original skull material."
