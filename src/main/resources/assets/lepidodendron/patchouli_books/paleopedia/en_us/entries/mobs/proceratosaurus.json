This small predator, estimated to grow up to 3 m long, is known from a single almost complete skull. Despite its name, this animal is not related to Ceratosaurus in any way but rather it was one of the earliest members of the Tyrannosauroidea;"

It wasn't until the 1980s that the moving of Ceratosaurus out of Coelurosauria prompted people into re-examining the remains of Proceratosaurus; at this point in time the animal had been reassigned as a relative of Ornitholestes by Gregory S. Paul,"

And so Ornitholestes and Proceratosaurus were placed inside Allosauroidea in the 80s and there they remained until the early 2000s, when more research on these animals finally placed them inside Coelurosauria where they rest today."

Proceratosaurus lived in coastal environments and probably hunted small animals like morganucodonts, docodonts and small reptiles; the nasal crest, similar to some other proceratosaurs may have worked both as display but also as an organ to relieve the skull from stresses while biting"
