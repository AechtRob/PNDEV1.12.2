The holotype was roughly 70 cm long, however due to it not being fully grown, it's very probable this animal could grow larger than this. Originally dated to the Early Cretaceous, the animal for a while was considered to be from the Jehol Group, statement subsequently corrected when the correct origin of the holotype was pinpointed to the Upper Jurassic of the Tiaojishan"

Compared to other Heterodontosaurids, Tianyulong's proportions were quite unique; It had a large head attached to a short neck, a long tail, long legs and quite short forelimbs, unusual in other members of the group. Tianyulong's discovery was quite remarkable as its remains preserved traces of long filamentous integument, similar to that seen in theropods; these filaments were not branched,"

Before Tianyulong's discovery, heterodontosaurians were a group restricted to the Lower Jurassic of South Africa. Tianyulong was thus vital in understanding the extent of heterodontosaurids in the Jurassic and to bring further evidence potentially suggesting feathering wasn't a derived trait of theropods as much as a basal trait in Dinosauria as a whole."
