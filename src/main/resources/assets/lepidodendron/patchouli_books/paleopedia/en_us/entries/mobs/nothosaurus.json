Perhaps the most known among its peers, this large marine predator had short but powerful limbs ending in webbed toes and a strong tail, clear adaptations to an aquatic lifestyle."

			"text": "Between 1-4 m long, with a few specimens potentially larger from Germany and Italy, the Nothosaurus could resemble another group of marine reptiles to the inexperienced eye such as the plesiosaurs, to which they were not related to. The animal is often compared ecologically to a seal, as both are aquatic predators that feed on fish; However, the comparisons between the two end there."

Most notably known to have been able to move both on land and water, "

More than a dozen species of Nothosaurus are known from around the globe, "

The same year as the latest described species was named, a study was conducted on all known Nothosaurus and relatives to test their relations and discovered the genus was probably polyphyletic, meaning some of the animals we call Nothosaurus today might change name in the future as we revisit the fossils of these animals."
