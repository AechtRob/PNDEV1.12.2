In 1888 the remains were reassigned to the new genus Cumnoria but then quickly moved inside Camptosaurus just one year later, where it remained for over a century."

In 2015 the genus was once again lumped inside of Camptosaurus, position once again rivaled in 2023 when a new paper regarded it as separate without awcknowledging the 2015 publication on the matter."
