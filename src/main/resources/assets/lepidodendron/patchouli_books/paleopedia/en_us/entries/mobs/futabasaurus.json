In 1968, at Futaba Group of Fukushima prefecture, Japan, Tadashi Suzuki, a high school student found a fossil of elasmosaurid plesiosaur. This was one of the first famous fossils of large reptiles in Japan, and until that it was thought that such fossils could not be found in Japan, a country with a small land area."

One famous example is an episode of the Japanese manga, Doraemon, focused on this plesiosaur and was made into a movie, which became a huge hit. The fossil was officially named Futabasaurus suzukii in 2006."

Numerous Cretalamna teeth have been found around its fossil, suggesting that it was probably scavenged by these sharks after death."
