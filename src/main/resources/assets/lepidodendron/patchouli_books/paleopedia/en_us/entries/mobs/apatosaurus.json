			"text": "Apatosaurus is a famous sauropod from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation. A. ajax was named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877 and A. louisae was named by William Holland in 1916. Although many may feel more familiar with A. ajax, A. louisae is known from more complete remains. Apatosaurus gives name to the subfamily of Apatosaurinae which was only considered a valid grouping since 2015. Apatosaurus is well known for the controversy involving the disputed genus of Brontosaurus."

Brontosaurus was then considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus until 2015 when it was reassessed as its own genus based on 13 characteristics. Despite the superficial mainstream appeal at the so-called \"revival\" of Brontosaurus, this study still remains contested within Paleontology. "

The ventrolateral processes were interpreted as supporting keratinous bosses or neck spikes. The term of this, \"Brontosmash\" was coined by Mark Witton in October of the same year. "
