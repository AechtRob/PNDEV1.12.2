The wood displays primitive features, but appears to belong to plants somewhere fairly basal within angiosperms/gymnosperms. At least some forms of Sahnioxylon are likely to be the trunks of larger Bennettities plants, and we follow this suggestion here. The fossils are often of good stature and so seem to be able"

As most Bennettities plants display a divaricate branching habit (Y-shaped branching), very like modern Banksia, we have adopted that structure here: as seen in some full-plant discoveries (see $(l:plants/wielandiella)Wielandiella$(/l)) we know that many of these plants produced flowers/cones at the ends of shoots,"

Bennettites were not Angiosperms, but are known to have usually produced sometimes dramatic flower-like or cone-like structures for pollination and seed production, and so we have added the suggestion of floral structures to our plant."
