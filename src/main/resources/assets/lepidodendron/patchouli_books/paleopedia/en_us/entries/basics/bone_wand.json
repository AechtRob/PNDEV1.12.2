It will need, in fact, a Time Reversal enchantment, either found in certain chests as loot (like in desert temples), as a random enchantment in an enchantment table or as a guaranteed max level trade with a Palaeobotanist villager."

Similarly, once a portal frame of the appropriate material is constructed (in the same shape as a Nether portal), simply right clicking it with the enchanted wand will open the portal"
