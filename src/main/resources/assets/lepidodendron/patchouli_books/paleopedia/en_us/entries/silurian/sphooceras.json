			"text": "Sphooceras is a genus of Orthocerid cephalopod from the Silurian of the Czech Republic. Incredibly characteristic for this animal was the anatomy of the phragmocone itself, being among the only known shelled cephalopods to have shed pieces of its shell as it grew. After shedding the shell, the animal would cover the apical part of the remaining phragmocone in callus,"

The shell of this animal was at least partially covered by mantle, as seen by preserved vascular imprints found on it, making it among the earliest known examples of an endocochleate cephalopod in the fossil record; the same specimen preserved traces of pigmentation on its shell."
