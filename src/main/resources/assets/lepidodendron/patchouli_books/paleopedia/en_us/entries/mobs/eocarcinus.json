The name, Eocarcinus, best interpreted to mean “early crab” accurately describes this ancient crustacean, which is generally regarded as the oldest known member of the group Brachyura, or “true crabs.”"

			"text": "Eocarcinus clearly illustrates the evolution of modern crabs from earlier elongate decapods, as it is intermediate in features between these two forms. The carapace is wide and flattened, though not to the same degree as modern brachyurans. The pleon, or abdomen, is proportionally larger than in modern crabs, and it is unclear whether it would have been folded under the body. "
