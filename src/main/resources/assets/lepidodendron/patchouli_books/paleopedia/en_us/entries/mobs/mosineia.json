Mosineia has been connected to, and found with, fossil trackways on tidal flat strata that were known for 150 years. Whilst many have suggested that these trackways prove Mosineia went onto the land to breed and feed away from the danger of predators, most also agree that the discovery of its"

For example there may have been a small bump or dune with the water that a Mosineia would walk on, and once the tide went out the trackways that it left behind would then be exposed to the air. This also leads into another likely example, in that sometimes a Mosineia would test its luck and fail, becoming stranded out of water, and forming the trackways on"

The specific name derives from the Latinised surname of Robert MacNaughton, the discoverer of the locality that Mosineia hails from."
