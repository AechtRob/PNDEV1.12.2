Its powerful jaws and superficially almost rodent-esque front teeth suggest that it may have been either herbivorous or possibly durophagous. It is also thought to have been semi-aquatic, with adaptations suggesting"

The babies were also relatively well developed, indicating they were able to fend for themselves from an early age. This suggests that Kayentatherium and other tritylodonts may have used a different parenting strategy from most modern mammals: Instead of investing more parental energy into fewer offspring,"
