This animal, maybe growing to 15-20 cm in length, is known only from some pieces of the top of its skull and a series of nuchal horns from different individuals. Despite the fragmentary remains, the nuchal horns that were discovered are unmistakably belonging to a basal Coccodontoidean Pycnodont,"

The placement of Congopycnodus in the family tree remains unclear to this day, being instead assigned as a precursor to Gebrayelichthyidae and Gladiopycnodontidae. What makes Congopycnodus an outlier compared to its peers was its habitat;"
