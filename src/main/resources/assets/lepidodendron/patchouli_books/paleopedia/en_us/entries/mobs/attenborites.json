			"text": "Attenborites janeae comes from the Upper Ediacaran, with fossils found in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia. It is a wrinkled ovoid lifeform, growing up to 2.5 cm in diameter. It was unknown whether Attenborites was either a benthic or pelagic lifeform, that was until a recent paper looked at all known specimens. It was first noted that all specimens had a very sharp outer margin with no attachments to the seafloor, very much suggesting they were not tethered"

The next thing that was noted is that the amount of Attenborites preserved in such a small area and in one location is highly similar to how other pelagic forms are preserved, as they tend to cluster together, specially if they are a free-floating forms. With all this considered, it has been accepted that Attenborites is a pelagic lifeform, although it is still unknown what they are related to."
