			"text": "Dubreuillosaurus is a species of Megalosaurid from the Middle Jurassic of France. The animal, growing potentially up to 9 m long, was a rather large theropod for its time and area. Differentiating this animal from other species in the family is the unusually long skull, around three times as long as it was tall and the lack of any type of crests, although that might've been influenced by the immature nature of the only known specimen."

The only known specimen was discovered in Bathonian layers of the Calcaire de Caen"

The original remains of Dubreuillosaurus were partly excavated and reported in 1994, however, by the time official excavations started 4 years later, the rocks of the quarry containing the rest of the specimen had already been crushed and spread by bulldozers,"

The genus was originally named as a species of Poekilopleuron prior to the reassembling of the specimen being completed, but the assignment was tentative and uncertain, suspicion later turned true when it was reassigned to its own genus in 2005."
