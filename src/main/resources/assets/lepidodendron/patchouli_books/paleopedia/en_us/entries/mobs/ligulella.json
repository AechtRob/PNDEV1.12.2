This very small freshwater animal, often not longer than 5 cm, was described in 1955 on the basis of more than 100 specimens coming from the Kisangani formation (formerly known as the Stanleyville formation), once part of a riverine and lacustrine environment."

			"text": "Immediately apparent when looking at this tiny animal is the head, ornamented by a shield-like skull roof, topped with a thin layer of ganoin which gave it a rather atypical armored appearance; this ganoin roof would grow in such a way as to create a fringe of hard bony spines along the borders of the head, the function of which is unknown."

With the description of a second species of this animal, however, it became apparent this little fish couldn't be housed alongside those other Teleosts and so,"
