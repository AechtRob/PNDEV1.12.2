There is a different fossiliferous stone for each prehistoric time period. The longer ago the fossiliferous stone dates from, the lower down you will find it in each dimension, and the lower down it is the rarer the generation will be."

When broken with a $(l:basics/geologicpick)Geologic Pick$(/l) it has a chance to drop raw fossils from its time period."
