			"text": "Acanthostega lived during the Upper Devonian, and was one of the earliest-known tetrapods. Its name means \"spiny roof\". It was around 60 cm long and was still fish-like, as such it could not have lived much of a terrestrial life. The front fins had been adapted with eight webbed, digit-like structures on each \"hand\". However, it is thought that the structure of the limbs would have meant actual walking on land would have been impossible as they could not"

Likewise, while it possessed air-breathing lungs as well as gills, the shape of the chest implies that it would have had difficulty breathing without water supporting its rib cage (perhaps it could flop and drag itself around a little bit in an emergency). We think that Acanthostega probably lived in shallow, marginal, plant-filled ecosystems,"
