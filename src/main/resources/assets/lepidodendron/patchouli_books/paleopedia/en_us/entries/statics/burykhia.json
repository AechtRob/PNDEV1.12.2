			"text": "Burykhia hunti comes from the Upper Ediacaran, with fossils found in the White Sea, Russia. It is a small, sac-like lifeform, growing up to 13 cm in height. Due to its overall appearance, Burykhia may have affinities with ascidians, which would result in Burykhia being the oldest known ascidian. It is also possibly related to the younger but more incomplete Ausia, which has helped with the classification of Ausia itself."

The specific name derives from the surname of Nathan Hunt, who has contributed to the study of Neoproterozoic rocks in Russia."
